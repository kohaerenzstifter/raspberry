This is a simple but extensible http(s) server (/usr/bin/httpd) and plugin (/usr/lib/httpd/libhttpdWwwidget.so) which you can run on your Raspberry Pi to serve my Android App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kohaerenzstiftung.wwwidget) in order to have screenshots of arbitrary websites display as a widget on your Android home screen.
To run the server, first create a configuration file httpd.conf with the following content:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is the "main" config section
[main]
# minimum number of preforked server processes
minHandlers=1
# maximum number of preforked server processes
maxHandlers=5
# listen port
port=8080
# plugin directory
pluginDirectory=/usr/lib/httpd/
# secure=no means HTTP, secure=yes means HTTPS
secure=yes
# path to server certificate
serverCertPath=/etc/ssl/certs/kohaerenzstiftung.selfhost.me.crt
# path to server key
serverKeyPath=/etc/ssl/private/kohaerenzstiftung.selfhost.me.key
# path to trust certificate
caCertPath=/etc/ssl/certs/ca.kohaerenzstiftung.selfhost.me.crt

# This is the config section for wwwidget plugin
[wwwidget]
# authentication password
password=geheim

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then start the server as follows:

httpd -d -l /var/log/khttpd/ -c httpd.conf

Short explanation of the command line parameters:

-d: Run as a daemon in the background
-l: <directory>: path to directory where log files will be written (httpd.out and httpd.err)
-c <file>: path to config file

Then, in my Android app, enter the following for server in the preferences activity:

<server>:<port>

Also enter your chosen password and (un)select httpS.

Now you're all set.
